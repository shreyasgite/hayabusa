Over the years, I have built special skills to poke the data in many unique ways. AI models are vital, however, the data that goes into one is even more so. Working at a medical startup, testing jet engines, or building a self-driving car; I have come to cherish the complexity that comes with data.

Generating datasets over a longer timeline is often underestimated expertise, I have been fortunate to have a lot of experience there. Apart from that, most of my expertise is in domain adaptation, domain randomisation and large multi-modal training. 

We, humans, are a product of our environment. Our biases, our beliefs, our morals are all derivative of the experiences that we have. And experiences in return can also be defined as a well-curated data stream in a sequential manner. Which is not very different from building data pipelines and architecture design in machine learning. 

I have been lucky in my journey so far as to have built useful intuition and valuable expertise in working with critical machine learning systems. Intuition for data plays an enormous part in assessing business cases, business impact and designing machine learning processes.
