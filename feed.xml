As the number of manufacturing stations in space increased, there was a higher demand for the orbiters to man these space factories. The food needed for this many workers in space was proving to be a big hurdle for the space manufacturing startups to break even. It was eating into precious storage space for high-value goods and raw materials, with more rockets supplying food then the raw materials for factories. That’s when one of the new space factory startups created a program to synthetically mutate the orbiters’ cells to produce energy from light. It was rudimentary at first; it only added a small percentage of the total required calories. And the mutation was temporary, lasting around 28 days, a typical working shift in space factories.</summary></entry></feed>
