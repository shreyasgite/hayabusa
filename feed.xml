As the number of manufacturing stations in the space increased, there was a higher demand for the orbiters to man these space factories. The food needed for this many workers in the space was proving to be a big hurdle for the space manufacturing startups to break even. It was eating into precious storage space for high-value goods and raw materials, with more Rockets supplying food then the raw materials for factories.  That’s when one of the new space factory startups created a program to synthetically mutate the orbiters’ cell to produce energy from the light. It was rudimentary at first; it only added a small percentage of the total required calories. And the mutation was temporary, lasted around 28 days, a typical working shift in space factories.</summary></entry></feed>
