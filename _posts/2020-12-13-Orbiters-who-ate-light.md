It started with the orbiters. As the number of manufacturing stations in the space increased, there was a higher demand for the orbiters to man these space factories. The food needed for this many workers in the space was proving to be a big hurdle for the space manufacturing startups to break even. It was eating into precious storage space for high-value goods and raw materials, with more Rockets supplying food then the raw materials for factories. 
That’s when one of the new space factory startups created a program to synthetically mutate the orbiters’ cell to produce energy from the light. It was rudimentary at first; it only added a small percentage of the total required calories. And the mutation was temporary, lasted around 28 days, a typical working shift in space factories.

However, once the gate was open... Space agencies, (Asteroid) mining companies and the Martian convention took the baton and continued to push humanity into its new era: the synthetic evolution of human beings.

Within a decade we had the technology to generate most of our calories from light and a handful of pills. Without the need for digesting, the human body needed much less energy and several organs became obsolete. We started to re-engineer our bodies for their new functionality. First, we got rid of the intestine, then the stomach. Kidneys got smaller. We lost our teeth and our jaws became more narrow. As we needed fewer calories to maintain homeostasis, we directed the excess energy towards the brain. This energy led to the creation of a new layer: the neural cortex.

A century after the first orbiter was modified, we were a new species. Our torso, harbouring fewer organs, was more narrow than that of our ancestors. So was our jaw. We developed a larger brain and eyes to perceive the new reality unknown before to the mankind; making us...!
