Somewhere on Discord in 2025 
HypnoRains: Yup, my recent content contributed 1.409 percent to AI-8's highest score on the LIFE benchmark. 
R0ck3r_kitty: Woh! That's a huge contribution from a single creator. You're rich, baby!
HypnoRains: Looks like I am.

Back in the summer of 2021, there was a new social network on the rise. You could share any form of digital content, videos, stories, code, or games. The only rule was that the content had to be original as it was used to train the next generation of AIs. As creators owned their content as NFTs, they got a little bit rich when it was auctioned or leased to different companies and labs to train their A(G)Is.

Stars were assigned to this data, depending upon its value for training the AIs. And the creators who earned the highest stars were paid handsomely. They soon figured out that the more diverse the content was, the more stars it generated. The same was with the multimodality of the content. E.g., a car driving video, with a person doing a live commentary about the scene and driving decisions, was highly rewarded. Sports commentary, cooking videos, or Yoga videos were hit for a time. New 3D sensors on the phones, mixed reality devices also gave a new dimension for the creators to play with. Within a couple of years after launching the app, a glorious amount of unique data was made available for training the AIs. 

With better tools for testing and representing the models, we understood better which datapoints contributed directly to the models' progression or regression. Soon, most AI labs had automatic processes to buy content that would add value to the data and move the performances of the models further on SOTA. As the machines started making their own decision on selecting the next right data, humans created more perspectives for machines to learn from.
